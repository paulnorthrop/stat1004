## Introduction to Probability and Statistics

### What does stat1004 do?

The `stat1004` package provides R code, datasets and vignettes (tutorials demonstrating how to use R code) to help students taking STAT1004 Introduction to Probability and Statistics at University College London to understand the course material and to see how R can be used to perform some of the analyses in the course.

The package is: 

* in the early stages of development;
* probably of little use to people not taking STAT1004 at UCL.

### Installation

To install the package from GitHub type the following at the R Console command prompt `>`

```{r installation1, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

You only need to do this (install the `devtools` package) once.  Then install `stat1004` (or reinstall it to get the latest version) using 

```{r installation2, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("paulnorthrop/stat1004")
```


### Getting started

Then type 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(stat1004)
?stat1004
```

to open the main help page, which contains links to vignettes, datasets and other sources of information.

You will find that some vignettes contain ideas that we have not yet covered in lectures.  If you want to try to understand these ideas before we cover them then please use the links to further information that have been provided.

If you have any questions about this package please ask them via the
[STAT1004 Moodle Discussion Forum](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/hsuforum/view.php?id=1410864).
