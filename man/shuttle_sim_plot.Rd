\title{Uncertainty in fitted linear logistic regression curve}
\usage{
shuttle_sim_plot(n_sim = 50, plot_real_data = TRUE, n_reps = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_sim}{An integer scalar.  The number of fake datasets to simulate,
and hence the number of curves from simulated data to appear in the plot.}

\item{plot_real_data}{A logical scalar.  Should we add to the plot the
real data and the linear logistic curve fitted to the real data?
\code{real_data = TRUE} for ``yes'' and \code{real_data = FALSE}
for ``no``.}

\item{n_reps}{An integer scalar.  The number of flights to simulate
for each of the 23 (pre-disaster) temperatures in the real dataset.
For example, \code{n_reps = 10} means that we simulate a dataset of
size 230.}

\item{...}{Further argments to be passed to the \code{lines} function
used to draw the curves for the simulated datasets.}
}
\value{
Nothing is returned, just the plot is produced.
}
\description{
Illustrates the uncertainty in the fitted values of the probability
of O-ring distress for different values of temperature, based on the
linear logistic regression model fitted to the real data.
Fake data from this fitted model are simulated repeatedly using
the function \code{\link{shuttle_sim}}.  The linear logistic model
is fitted to each of these simulated datasets.
A plot is produced containing the real proportions of distressed
O-rings, the logistic curve fitted to the real data and each of the
logistic curves fitted to the fake data.
